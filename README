Prerequisites:

RHEL, Centos:
$ sudo yum install make glibc-devel openssl-devel

Debian, Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install make libc6-dev libssl-dev


Libevent2:

Some newer Linux systems (Ubuntu 12.04) come with libevent2 already installed.
On older systems, libevent2 must be installed manually, following these steps:

1. Remove the old libevent. The libevent2 library will be backward compatible,
   so software relying on the old libevent will still work with libevent2.

   $ sudo yum remove libevent

2. Download the latest libevent2 from libevent.org, e.g. libevent-2.0.20-stable.tar.gz.

   $ wget https://github.com/downloads/libevent/libevent/libevent-2.0.20-stable.tar.gz

3. Extract, and go to the resulting directory.
   
   $ tar -xvf libevent-2.0.20-stable.tar.gz
   $ cd libevent-2.0.20-stable

4. Configure libevent2 to be installed in /usr/lib and install it. (Amazingly,
   we have found the default configuration may install in /usr/local/lib.)
		
   $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

5. Make sure the new library is recognized.
 
   $ sudo /sbin/ldconfig


Aerospike libevent2 client:
